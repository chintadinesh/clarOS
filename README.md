# clarOS

A starter kit for the Texas Instruments Tiva C Series [TM4C123GXL][launchpad]
LaunchPad, containing only software with BSD-compatible licenses and no
"TI Commercial" code. Tested on macOS 10.14.3 with Homebrew, but should work
on any other Unix that supports [Linuxbrew][linuxbrew].

## Getting Started

1. Install Homebrew from <https://brew.sh> if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository with `git clone git@github.com:kk4ead/claros`.
3. Download and install all dependencies with `cd claros && make init`.
4. (TODO) Build the demo project with `make demo`.
5. (TODO) Connect a LaunchPad and run `make demo-flash`.
   You should see the LED on the board start cycling through colors,
   and the name of each color should print to the console.

## (TODO) Creating a Project

## (TODO) TivaWare and ValvanoWare Authors
